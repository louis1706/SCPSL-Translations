Credits / Author
---
You are only eligible for the credits.txt if you meet one of these requirements.

1. Updating one translation (or more) regularly with each update.
2. You added a full translation
3. You have updated translation files with content of more than:
    * 2 files with each exceeding **250 characters**
    * files with **500 characters** or more

Updating files with single character fixes or fixing two sentences does not make you eligible for your name as an author in the manifest / credits. 

Also, if you have not updated a translation after more than a year and the translations did undergo major changes (that includes changes to more than 50% of all files, also counting in addition of files), your name should be removed. [^note]

### Do **not** included any advertisements/pointers to non-game stuff other than the translation author in the manifest file


[^note]: 
    This does not apply to translations with just one translator, but rather to those with more than 2 translators which have also not updated the language since original submission.
